# Space Missions Data Analysis

This project analyzes space mission launches from 1957 onwards, using a dataset that includes details such as mission status, cost, and the organizations responsible for the launches. Various visualizations are created to understand trends and insights, including the dominant organizations in different time periods, mission failures, and launch prices over time.

## Dataset

The dataset includes data on space missions from 1957, provided by `nextspaceflight.com`. It contains information on:
- Mission launch dates
- Organizations responsible for the launches
- Mission status (Success/Failure)
- Mission cost in USD millions
- Country of the launch

## Visualizations

### 2. Organization with the Most Launches Year-on-Year
This chart displays the leading organization for each year, highlighting the dominance of Soviet space organizations in the 1970s and 1980s, as well as SpaceX's dominance in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

### 3. Total Launch Failures Year-on-Year
This line chart visualizes the total number of mission failures each year, helping track how the space industry has evolved in terms of safety and success.

### 4. Launch Prices Over Time
A line chart showing how the average cost of rocket launches has changed over time, helping to track whether launches have become more or less expensive as technology has evolved.
